# Patterns

Tracked patterns and anomalies across the wiki.

## Ingest — 2026-06-17 (Agent Harness Engineering)

- **New tag**: `#harness-engineering` introduced for the harness-design body of work. Not yet added to CLAUDE.md's domain-tag table (that table holds the 7 core domain tags; this is a topical tag like `agentic-workflows` and `token-optimization`, which also live outside the table).
- **Gap — people entity pages**: this source leans on several named figures with no entity page yet: **Viv Trivedy** (coined "harness engineering" and "Harness-as-a-Service"), **Addy Osmani** (author), **Dex Horthy** / **HumanLayer** (the "skill issue" reframe), **Birgitta Böckeler**, **Fareed Khan**. The wiki currently has only one entity (`ai-2027-project`). Worth creating entity pages on the next ingest that touches the same people, rather than thin stubs now.
- **Gap — Ralph Loop / hooks as standalone concepts**: both are currently folded into `harness-engineering` and `agentic-workflows`. If a future source goes deep on either (e.g., a dedicated Ralph Loop write-up), promote to its own concept page.
- **Cross-source nuance (resolved, not a conflict)**: `agentic-frameworks` notes CrewAI's retry loop corrupting good parameters ("more self-review is not automatically safer"); this source argues planner/evaluator splits help. Reconciled on both pages: harm comes from a self-review retry mutating correct output, benefit comes from an independent evaluator. Who verifies matters more than how much.

## Raw-vs-Wiki Provenance Audit — 2026-06-12

Full comparison of every `raw/` document against its digested wiki source page.

### 🔴 CRITICAL — Unsourced page cluster (open, needs Danny's decision)
- **`anthropic-interpretability` (source) + `mechanistic-interpretability` (concept)**: no raw document about interpretability exists in the repo or in git history. The claimed source ("Executive Summary: Mechanistic Interpretability for Acting Virtuously") matches nothing on disk. The only Executive Summary PDF in `raw/attachments/` is a ChatGPT research report about **Claude Skills** — likely what the 2026-05-06 ingest was supposed to digest. Internal red flags: "golden ticket hypothesis" is not established Anthropic terminology; the cited paper title is garbled. Both pages now carry ⚠️ Conflicts sections. **Proposed resolution: delete both pages, or supply a real raw document and re-ingest. Awaiting approval.**

### 🟠 Fabricated attributions (fixed this audit)
- `karpati-claude-best-practices`: the person is **Andrej Karpathy** (ex-Tesla AI, OpenAI founding team — both stated in the raw); transcript artifacts "Karpati"/"Carpathy" were baked into the wiki as a real name. Also cited a GitHub URL (`forest-protocols/karpati-skills`) that appears nowhere in the raw — removed. Slug kept for link stability.
- `ai-scaffold-hierarchy`: attributed to "Simon Willison" with a simonwillison.net URL — neither appears in the raw transcript (an unidentified speaker discussing Codex plugins). Both removed; author marked unknown.

### 🟡 Accuracy/completeness fixes (fixed this audit)
- `agentic-workflows-business-transcription`: page was a table of contents, not a digest. Expanded with actual content (agentic loop = planning→tool use→memory→reflection; DO framework details; reviewer+documentation sub-agent pattern). DO framework expands to "Directive Orchestration **and Execution**" (`directives/` + `executions/` folders) — the wiki had dropped half the name; also fixed in `agentic-workflows` concept.
- `ai-2027`: "TSMC supplies 80%+ AI chips" tightened to the raw's actual claim: ">80% of *American* AI chips".

### ✅ Verified accurate (spot-checked against raws)
- `ai-2027` (stock +30%, 10K protest, −35% net approval, US 70% compute — all confirmed)
- `llm-dcp` (12.9x compression confirmed), `introducing-dynamic-workflows` (Bun: Zig→Rust, 750k lines, 99.8%, 11 days confirmed), `claude-code-dynamic-workflow-patterns` (all six pattern names confirmed)
- Attribution fields confirmed for: `anatomy-of-the-.claude-folder`, `prompt-compression`, `self-annealing-ai-agents-explained`, `skill-authoring-best-practices`, `llm-dcp`
- `prompt-engineering-hacks` ("Nick" confirmed), `claude-code-data-analysis` (sales/customer/clarifying confirmed), `claude-skills-build-first-assistant` ("Co-work" matches raw transcript)

### 🆕 New ingest from this audit
- `claude-skills-technical-report` — the previously mis-ingested `Executive_Summary.pdf` (ChatGPT deep-research report on Claude Skills internals) now has a proper source page. The two PNG diagrams in `raw/attachments/` are figures from it.

## Lint Check — 2026-06-12

### ✅ Contradictions
- None detected.

### ✅ Stale Content
- No superseded claims identified.

### ⚠️ Orphans (0 inbound links) — fixed this pass
- `anatomy-of-the-.claude-folder` — linked OUT to 4 concepts but none linked back (broken bidirectionality). Fixed: backlinks added to `claude-skills`, `context-management`, `skill-design`, `model-context-protocol`.
- `prompting` (concept) — never linked from its own source pages. Fixed: links added from `prompt-engineering-hacks` and `google-ai-prompt-engineering-course`.
- `prompt-engineering-hacks` (source) — no inbound links. Fixed: linked from `prompting` concept and `google-ai-prompt-engineering-course`.

### ⚠️ Gaps — fixed this pass
- `wiki/sources/prompt-compression.md` frontmatter contained a phantom link `[[Nivetha Suruliraj]]` (author, no page intended). Converted to plain text.
- `raw/Top 5 Open-Source Agentic AI Frameworks in 2026.md` was present in `raw/` since 2026-05-15 but never ingested (no log entry, no source page). Ingested this pass → `sources/top-5-agentic-frameworks-2026` + new concept `agentic-frameworks`.

### ⚠️ Index Drift — fixed this pass
- `best-practices-for-skill-creators` and `optimizing-skill-descriptions` source pages were missing from `wiki/index.md`.
- `ai-2027-project` (entity) was filed under Concepts; index had no Entities/Insights sections. Restructured.

### ⚠️ Structural Issues — fixed this pass
- `prompt-engineering-hacks.md` had path-prefixed links (`[[concepts/automation]]`, `[[concepts/claude-skills]]`) — same defect class previously fixed in `prompting.md` on 2026-06-05. Normalized.
- `google-ai-prompt-engineering-course.md` Connections section contained placeholder prose ("Links to prompting concepts in wiki/concepts/") instead of actual wiki links. Replaced with real links.

### ✅ Neglected Pages
- None — all pages updated within the last 30 days or untouched with no related new sources.

### ✅ Duplicates
- None. `skill-authoring-best-practices` and `best-practices-for-skill-creators` cover adjacent ground but trace to distinct raw documents; kept separate.

### ✅ Unsourced Claims
- Concept pages trace to source pages. New `agentic-frameworks` page labels its one extrapolation explicitly as inference.

### Near-orphans (1 inbound link) — accepted as leaf nodes
- `ai-2027-project`, `llm-dcp`, `karpati-claude-best-practices`, `claude-skills-build-first-assistant`, `self-annealing-ai-agents-explained`, `mechanistic-interpretability`/`anthropic-interpretability` pair. These are intentionally narrow; no forced connections added (hallucination guard).

## Lint Check — 2026-06-05

### ✅ Contradictions
- None detected. Claims across pages are consistent.

### ✅ Stale Content
- All pages updated within last 30 days. No superseded claims identified.

### ⚠️ Orphans (Pages with ≤1 Inbound Link)
These pages have minimal connections to the wiki graph:
- `^ai-2027-project` (entity) — linked only from `ai-2027.md` source
- `^claude-skills-build-first-assistant` — linked only from `skill-design.md`
- `^google-ai-prompt-engineering-course` — linked only from `prompting.md`
- `^karpati-claude-best-practices` — linked only from `skill-design.md`
- `^llm-dcp` — linked only from `prompt-compression.md`
- `^mechanistic-interpretability` — linked only from `anthropic-interpretability.md`
- `^self-annealing-ai-agents-explained` — linked only from `self-annealing.md`

**Recommendation**: Review for organic connections to add, or accept as leaf nodes if intentionally isolated.

### ⚠️ Missing Page Sections
- `wiki/sources/how-claude-code-works-large-codebases.md` — missing `## Notes` section (all other sources have one)
- `wiki/concepts/prompting.md` — has path-prefixed links in line 85: `[[concepts/automation]]`, `[[concepts/claude-skills]]`, `[[concepts/agentic-workflows]]`, `[[concepts/agents-vs-skills]]`

### ✅ Gaps (Missing Pages)
- All wiki links resolve to existing pages. No gaps detected.

### ✅ Neglected Pages
- No pages untouched >30 days while related sources have arrived.

### ✅ Duplicates
- No duplicate coverage identified.

### ✅ Unsourced Claims
- All concept pages include `## Source` or `Source:` sections linking to source pages.

## Content Patterns
